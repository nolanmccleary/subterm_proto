## Sub-Components

1. Audio stream

2. Audio frame

3. Translation model

4. Translated frame

5. Out buffer/file dump

## Optimizations

1. Application audio access latency

2. Ingoing pipeline (framing speed, frame processing, remove redundant frame data ect...)

3. Outgoing pipeline (write out translated data as fast as possible)
